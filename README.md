# Arduino+ for a better Arduino IDE

Arduino integrates features that are terribly missed in the IDE for a better coding experience.

## Features

* **Toggle Line Comments**: Quickly comment/uncomment lines with `//` - perfect for debugging!
* **Snippet Manager**: An enhanced clipboard to keep and modify several code snippets.

## Installation

### Automatic (recommended)

You need the VSIX file *arduinoplus.vsix* in the same folder with the installer. The installer will install the plugin in your home folder. 
  
#### Windows
```
Run install_arduinoplus_windows.bat as administrator
```

#### Linux
```
chmod +x install_arduinoplus_linux.sh
./install_arduinoplus_install_linux.sh
```

#### macOS
```
chmod +x install_arduinoplus_macos.sh
./install_arduinoplus_Install_macos.sh
```
